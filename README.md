# PokerDesktopApp

I created a desktop application with Java using a GUI. I used Swing (GUI framework for Java) to create the app. 
I created an artificial intelligence poker game using an algorithm from a previous poker program I've created. In the previous poker 
program, all input/output is done within the console. 

Gameplay
- Texas Hold'em Poker
- 2-5 players (1 user player and 1-4 AI players)
- 3 Styles of play: Last man standing, most money after 5 hands, and first to $1000.


All images have been created by myself using google draw.


TODO:
- Improve betting algorithm (prevent from raising multiple times within a betting round)
- Fix bug with tie breaks (should display all winners after hand and pot is shared)
