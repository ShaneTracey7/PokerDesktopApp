# PokerDesktopApp

I decided to try creating a desktop application using java using a GUI. I used Swing (GUI framework for Java) to create the app. 
I created an artificial intelligence poker game using an algorithm from a previous poker program I've created. In the previous poker 
program, all input/output is done within the console.
